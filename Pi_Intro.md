### Raspberry Pi intro Project
This is a organizaitonal document laying out the plans and documenting progress of my raspberry pi exploration project. This document should outline the project, goals, expected challenges and steps that I want to take with this project.

## Goals
The final product in mind is a robot arm with two segments capable of moving it's end effector to precise coordinates in a 2-dimentional plane.

The goal of this project is to gain knowledge and experiment with:
- Setting up a raspberry pi
- Establishing output and input signals to and from servo motors
- Using inverse kinematics to calculate joint angles from end effector locations.
- Design, model, and print structural components of the project.

# Steps

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB)
- Micro SD card (32GB)
- Adafruit Servo Hat for Raspberry Pi
- 2x 5 volt, 2 amp, 2.1 mm DC power supply
- Jumper wires (male to female)
- 2x Servo motors ([MG996R](https://www.amazon.ca/RGBZONE-MG996R-Torque-Digital-Helicopter/dp/B07RFRLRV8/?th=1))
